                        <h1>Junior School</h1>
                        <p>“The goal of early child hood education should be to activate a child’s own natural desire to learn”- Maria Montessori</p>
                        <p>At Banyan Tree School we firmly believe in a holistic approach to education, recognizing that a child’s development encompasses not only academic achievements but also their emotional, social and physical well-being. Our pedagogy is rooted in the latest research and best practices in child development, ensuring that each child receives a well-rounded education that prepares them for success in all aspects of life.</p>
                        <p>We follow a comprehensive curriculum that is designed to foster critical thinking, problem-solving skills and a love for learning. Through a combination of interactive lessons, hands-on activities and collaborative projects we aim to instil a lifelong passion for knowledge in our students.</p>
                        <p>Beyond textbooks and exams, our school is committed to creating a nurturing and inclusive environment where every child feels valued, respected, and safe. We have implemented robust safety measures to ensure the physical well-being of our students, including secure premises, trained staff.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, we understand that cognitive development is not limited to the classroom. Our school offers a wide range of extracurricular activities including sports, arts, Art, Music, Dance, Theatre, Yoga, Martial Arts, Storytelling and Exploration to provide students with opportunities to explore their interests and develop their talents. These activities not only enhance their cognitive abilities but also promote teamwork, leadership skills, and personal growth.</p>
                        <p>We strive to create a happy, safe, and caring environment where academics and cognitive growth are seamlessly integrated at Banyan Tree School.</p>

                        <h1>Middle School</h1>
                        <p>Middle school is the overpass which bridges the distance between junior school and high school. Students develop not only good practices, but they are also set on a journey to get to know themselves, develop socio-emotional skills and start being independent.</p>
                        <p>Banyan Tree School believes in supporting and preserving students’ mental well-being and enriching their socio-emotional state. In order to facilitate the above set goals, the teachers of the middle school follow certain protocols and regimes. They follow activity-based teaching-learning methodology, “learning by doing” pedagogy and many more.</p>
                        <p>Teachers at middle school of BTS family protect the overall being of a student and constantly strive to achieve the best for them.</p>
