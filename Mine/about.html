                        <h1>Vision and Mission of School</h1>
                        <p>Our values are at the heart of our teaching practices. In line with the vision of the school, we celebrate students for exhibiting the core values: integrity, desire for knowledge, tolerance and respect for others. Every student and staff at Banyan Tree School internalises these values as we talk about them a lot, provide examples in school and in the curriculum.
                            Every member of our school takes great ownership and pride in our school in ensuring we operate effectively, efficiently and with care.</p>
                        <p>We work in strong partnership with our parent community through the PTA and school events. Daily communication and feedback makes way for a close parent-teacher partnership and ensures we meet the needs of our students and families. </p>
                        <p>Thank you for your interest in our school! You will be happy with the culture of care and high academic standards your children experience here. We want all our children to take with them happy memories of their years with us. It is with this commitment that every staff member of school connects with every child on an individual level as they lead them on the road to life success.</p>
